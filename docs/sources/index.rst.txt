Welcome to RFDT
========================

RFDT is a fully differentiable radio simulator designed for Digital Twin.
The paper is currently in submission, hence the current webpage is in anonymous.

Abstract
------------

Digital twins, virtual replicas of physical systems, have revolutionized various industries. 
However, their potential in radio frequency (RF) applications has been limited by the unidirectional 
nature of conventional simulators. Here, we present RFDT, the first inverse simulator for RF digital twins, 
enabling bidirectional interaction between virtual and physical realms. RFDT overcomes the 
challenges of discontinuity and local non-convexity in RF simulations optimization through 
path-space differentiation with edge reparametrization, making the simulator end-to-end differentiable 
for arbitrary scene parameters. We introduce a surrogate model for radar waveform to address phase 
periodicity issues.  Our proposed
approach harnesses the power of physical-based simulation with differentiable computing.
Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RFDT significantly enhances existing machine 
learning systems, improves robotics applications, and facilitates physically constrained parameter searches. 
These advancements pave the way for more accurate and responsive RF digital twins, with potential applications 
in communications, autonomous systems, and smart environments.
